# Overview
The Pre-Generator plugin allows for efficient world generation using the `/pregen` command. It works best on Paper servers, where it utilizes asynchronous functionality for faster performance.

Note: This plugin does not support older versions because it uses features available only in Java 21. However, I plan to support future versions and further improve performance.

## Key Features
 - **Async Pre-Generation**: Utilizes server threads for efficient world generation.
 - **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust parallel tasks, update delay, world, and radius.

---

Works best on Paper servers. On non-Paper servers, the async functionality will not be used. It is recommended that you update your Paper server's `paper-global.yml` file:

## Config
```yaml
chunk-system:
  gen-parallelism: default
  io-threads: 12
  worker-threads: 12
```
   - Adjust `io-threads` and `worker-threads` to match your CPUâ€™s thread count. Default settings utilize only half.
   - Usage: `/pregen <ParallelTasksMultiplier> <PrintUpdateDelay in (Seconds/Minutes/Hours)> <world> <Radius (Blocks/Chunks/Regions)>`

## Command Usage
### Examples:
`/pregen 6 5s world 1000b`
- Pre-generates the `overworld`
- (threads * 6) results in a maximum of 72 concurrent parallel tasks
- Prints logs every 5 seconds
- 1000 block radius, (1000 / 16) = 62.5, rounded to 62 chunks, then squared to get total chunks, 62x62 = 3844 chunks that will need to be processed

`/pregen 2 2m world_nether 500c`
- Pre-generates the `nether`
- (threads * 2) results in a maximum of 24 concurrent parallel tasks
- Prints logs every 2 minutes
- 500 chunk radius, squared to get total chunks, (500 * 500) = 250,000 chunks that will need to be processed

`/pregen 1 12h world_the_end 100r`
- Pre-generates `the end`
- (threads * 1) results in a maximum of 12 concurrent parallel tasks
- Prints logs every 12 hours
- 100 region radius, 1 region is (32 * 32) chunks, to get the radius we multiply (32 * 100) = 3200, squared to get total chunks, (3200 * 3200) = 10,240,000 chunks that will need to be processed

`/pregen 4 10s world default`
- Pre-generates the `overworld`
- (threads * 4) results in a maximum of 48 concurrent parallel tasks
- Prints logs every 10 seconds
- `default` pre-generates to the world border of the selected world, you can use this if you set your world border manually using `/worldborder set #`

## Command Settings
## `ParallelTasksMultiplier`
- **Recommendation:** Stay below your thread count.
- **Function:** Limits the number of parallel chunk load tasks.
- **Calculation:** Multiplied by the number of threads available at server initialization. For example, if your server starts with 12 threads, the maximum number of parallel tasks allowed when **ParallelTasksMultiplier** is set to 6 will be 72.

### Performance Examples:
- **ParallelTasksMultiplier = 1:**
  - **Command:** `/pregen 1 5s world 100c`
  - **Chunks per second:** ~100-130 (on a 5600x CPU, depending on server activity and other system tasks)
  - **Time:** Finished in 1.33 minutes

- **ParallelTasksMultiplier = 6:**
  - **Command:** `/pregen 6 5s world 100c`
  - **Chunks per second:** ~130-200 (on a 5600x CPU, depending on server activity and other system tasks)
  - **Time:** Finished in 0.916 minutes

#### Summary:
- **Load Management:** Determines the load on your server.
- **Small Number:** Lower load, fewer chunks per second.
- **Large Number:** Higher load, faster chunk processing.
- **Best Practice:** Start at 1 and increase by 1 until you encounter constant overload; that's when you know you have pushed it too far.

## `World`
- Determines what world you want to pre-generate.
- Tab autocomplete will fetch all the vanilla worlds on the server and show them to you.
- Then you can choose which world you want and off you go.

## `Radius`
- Determines the radius of chunks that will be pre-generated.
- The supported units are blocks, chunks, and regions.
- To use it, you just have to add the letters `b`, `c`, or `r` next to the actual number.
- For example, **20000b** is a 20,000 block radius, **500c** is a 500 chunk radius, or **30r** is a 30 region radius.

## Commands:
- `/pregen`: `/pregen <ParallelTasksMultiplier> <PrintUpdateDelay in (Seconds/Minutes/Hours)> <world> <Radius in (Blocks/Chunks/Regions) or default>` Pre-generate any of the dimensions: overworld, nether, and end.
- `/pregenoff`: Turn off the pre-generation process.

## Permissions:
(**Default OP**)
- `chunker.pregen`: Grants permission to use the pre-generation command with customizable parameters.
- `chunker.pregenoff`: Grants permission to disable pre-generation using the `/pregenoff` command.
- `chunker.*`: Provides access to all Chunker commands.
